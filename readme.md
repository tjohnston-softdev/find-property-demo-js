# Find Property Demo (JavaScript)

## Introduction

This is my submission for a technical assessment offered to shortlisted candidates for one of the software development positions I interviewed for. The basic objective was to implement a Node JS function which searches for a given property in a key-value collection string.

Assessment instructions were sent as a PDF. I reinterpreted it as a [markdown file](./instructions.md) for public viewing.

The assessment was undertaken on 4 September 2021 and shared publicly on 7 September.

## Running

To run the script, clone the repository and execute `submission.js`. This runs the implemented function using the example input from the instructions and displays the results to console.
