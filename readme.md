# Find Property Demo (JavaScript)

This is my submission for a technical assessment offered to shortlisted candidates for one of the software development positions I interviewed for. The basic objective was to implement a Node JS function which searches for a given property in a key-value collection string.

Assessment instructions were sent as a PDF. I reinterpreted it as a [markdown file](./instructions.md) for public viewing.

The assessment was undertaken on 4 September 2021 and shared publicly on 7 September. An updated version with unit tests was released on 14 September.

## Running

1. Clone the repository. The assessment script is `submission.js`
2. Run `npm install` to download the unit testing libraries.
3. Run `npm test` to execute the assessment with example input and perform unit tests.
